# How To Set Up Browser Automation on ChromeOS

## Preface
This document was never supposed to exist. I had originally wanted to try web scraping using Selenium on my Chromebook (I activated the Linux development environment), but to my surprise, setting up Selenium, Chrome, and Firefox took 3 days. This is partly due to my inexperience, but also because there isn't a good, up-to-date guide on how to get Selenium working with Chrome and Firefox on ChromeOS. While people on Windows, Linus, and MacOS were able to stand on the shoulder of giants (they have hella resources), I had to stand on the ground.

Matt Gosden articulated this issue perfectly in his [article](https://medium.com/swlh/is-a-chromebook-good-for-coding-and-data-science-322babcd5512):

>Installing what you need to use Python or a similar language is a bit of a daunting task for a beginner on any system. In Chrome OS is particularly tricky >for beginners because itâ€™s not so well documented or supported.
>
>There is a chicken-and-egg problem here in that there are few developers using Chromebooks for development today and therefore there are fewer tools and >how-to guides to help new coders with the issues and installs.

This chicken-and-egg problem can have serious consequences, one of which is that it can make learning to code discouraging for people with lower incomes (this is just my reasoning I have no statistics to back me up lol). If you don't have a lot of money like me, Chromebooks are super attractive because they're cheaper than other laptops but they're still robust. So you get a Chromebook, happy with your purchase, only to hit a wall with installations that should be simple. You're not even coding yet but you're still having so much trouble. It feels awful, and exhausting if you spent hours finding a solution like me. It might even turn you away from coding.

I hope that this document can spare someone the hours I spent on getting Selenium to work with Chrome and Firefox. And if you're feeling bitter, take comfort in the fact that it only gets better from here. Coding is super fun. And maybe one day, you can help contribute your own discoveries. Be the giant you want to see in the world.
